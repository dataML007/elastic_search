To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.\\nIn the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it\\nOnce it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.\\nYou are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.\\nTo go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:\\nPython should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.\\nYou can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo \"cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path\" >> ~/.bashrc\\nYou can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc\\nYou have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.\\nYou can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).\\nYou will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip\\nNB: I had this error message when trying to install pipenv (https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5663):\\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can\\'t link /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libnvoptix_loader.so.1 to libnvoptix.so.1\\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1 is not a symbolic link\\nSo I had to create the following symbolic link:\\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1 /usr/lib64/libcuda.so\\n(Mélanie Fouesnard)'}},\n",
